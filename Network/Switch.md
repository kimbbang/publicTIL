# Switch

dedicated devices **within a network** that are designed to **aggregate multiple other devices** such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet     
keep track of what device is connected to which port     
it just sends it to the intended target, thus reducing network traffic.     

can facilitate many devices (from 3 to 63) using Ethernet cables.  

can operate at both layer 2 and layer 3 of the OSI model.   
However, these are exclusive in the sense that Layer 2 switches cannot operate at layer 3.  

layer 2 switch : send frames to devices  
layer 3 switch : send frames to devices + route packets to other devices using the IP protocol.
