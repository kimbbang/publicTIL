## Tier 

Tier 1 network : an Internet Protocol (IP) network that can reach every other network on the Internet solely via settlement-free interconnection (also known as settlement-free peering).  
Tier 1 networks can exchange traffic with other Tier 1 networks without paying any fees for the exchange of traffic in either direction.  
In contrast, some Tier 2 networks and all Tier 3 networks must pay to transmit traffic on other networks.

Tier 2 network: A network that peers for free with some networks, but still purchases IP transit or pays for peering to reach at least some portion of the Internet.
Tier 3 network: A network that solely purchases transit/peering from other networks to participate in the Internet.
