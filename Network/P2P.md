## P2P

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking

a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers.   
Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application.   
They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes

Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, <u>without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts</u>.  
Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional clientâ€“server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided
