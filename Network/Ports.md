## Ports

When a connection has been established (recalling from the OSI model's room), any data sent or received by a device will be sent through these ports.    
In computing, ports are a numerical value between 0 and 65535 (65,535).   
within 0 and 1024 (1,024) is known as a common port.

### Port Number	Description : Protocol

#### 21 : File Transfer Protocol (FTP)		
is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.    

#### 22 : Secure Shell (SSH)		
is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.    

#### 80 : HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

#### 443 : HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)		
HTTP function + securely using encryption.    

#### 445 : Server Message Block (SMB)	
is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); 
however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers.    

#### 3389 : Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)		
is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol).
