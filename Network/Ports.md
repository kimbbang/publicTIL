# Ports

are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server  

When a connection has been established (recalling from the OSI model's room), any data sent or received by a device will be sent through these ports.    
Every computer has a total of **65535** available ports    
within 0 and **1024** is known as a common port(=well-known port)
