## File System

* **NTFS** : New Technology File System   
is known as a **journaling** file system : In case of a failure, the file system can **automatically repair** the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file   


* Set specific **permissions** on folders and files   
Check permissions : Properties > Security > Group or user names    
[File and Folder Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb727008(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)   
   

* Alternate Data Streams (**ADS**).   
are a file attribute only found on the NTFS file system.   
Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data.

* Supports files larger than 4GB   
Folder and file compression   
Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)   
â€»Before NTFS, there was **FAT16/FAT32** (File Allocation Table) and **HPFS** (High Performance File System).    
FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards, etc
