## HTTPServer


Ubuntu machines come pre-packaged with python3.   
Python helpfully provides a lightweight and easy-to-use module called "HTTPServer".   
This module turns your computer into a quick and easy web server that you can use to serve your own files, where they can then be downloaded by another computing using commands such as curl and wget.

start HTTPServer module
```
tryhackme@linux3:/tmp# python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 
(http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
